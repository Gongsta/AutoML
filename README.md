# AutoML
In this repository,I explore automated machine learning using autokeras.
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Have an IDE installed to run the code, I used PyCharm with Python3.6. Note that autokeras 0.4 only supports Python 3.6 for the moment. 

### Dataset
Th dataset I used contains 5000 images of dogs and 5000 images of cats. I split it into a 80% and 20% training to test set ratio.
## Built With

* [Autokeras](https://autokeras.com/) - The library used for automated machine learning
